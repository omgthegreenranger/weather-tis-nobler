# Weather Tis Nobler in the mind to Suffer

## Task

Using the 5 Day Weather Forecast to retrieve weather data for cities. We should be able to provide a five-day forecast, but also local weather. The client will need to be able to provide their location data, which is saved in Local Storage for future referral.

## Usage

[Enter the page](https://omgthegreenranger.github.io/weather-tis-nobler/), and put in a location. On the modal, pick your location, and behold the weather!

## Further details

Responsive design is infuriating and I really wanted to make my 5-day forecast a bunch of accordions. It didn't work. Sorry!
